# Deliberative Process Protection Act (DPPA)
A bill to ensure all candidate legislation receives adequate deliberation before coming to a vote.

The text of the bill is in [DPPA.md](./DPPA.md)

## Goals
While the proximal motivation for this bill stems from the process which occured in the Senate's passage of the [tax code modifications](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1) on December 2, 2018, this bill is not a comment on the content of that Act.  Nor is it a protest to the passage of that Act. Rather, this bill is a bi-partisan comment on the _process_ by which that Act was brought to a vote and a strong statement that it embodied deeply flawed process.

Regardless of the content of a bill being brought to a vote or the party which sponsors the bill, it is irresponsible for the bill to be voted upon until all legislators in the body have been presented with a clear and final copy of the bill and have been given adequate time to review and reflect upon the content.
