# Deliberative Process Protection Act (DPPA)

A bill to ensure all candidate legislation receives adequate deliberation before coming to a vote.

## Bill Text

Except in cases of imminent national threat (as defined below), no bill may be brought to a floor vote until:

1. A final typed copy of the bill in machine searchable format, including all amendments or alterations, has been prepared.
2. The document described in clause #1 has been delivered to all members of the legislative body.
3. A review period of no less than 24 hours has elapsed between the delivery of the document (see clause #2) and the bill being brought to a vote.

When a bill is brought to a vote, the document being voted upon is that document delivered in clause #2. Any amendments or alterations offered after the preparation (clause #1), including annotations or hand-written notes, are not considered part of the bill being brought to vote.

### Imminent National Threat

Imminent National Threat is defined as an event or situation to which the legislative body must respond expeditiously. Examples may include authorization of war powers or emergency funding to respond to natural disasters.
